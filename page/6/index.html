  <h2><a href="/meanwhile-a-few-feet-down-the-hallway/">Meanwhile, a few feet down the hallway...</a></h2>
  <time datetime="2009-09-17" pubdate>Sep 17, 2009</time>
  <div class="summary"><p>While I&#8217;ve been taking my sweet time making upgrades to the half-bathroom, the kitchen has lurched ahead in our priorities. One cabinet has come free of the wall altogether, stretching slowly until it rested on a jar of flour on the counter. Our frustrations with the non-frostless freezer (the scraping of which always seems to lead to bodily injury) have mounted. Our microwave, though not quite a kitchen fixture, has fritzed its last fritz and is contributing to the general feeling of ill-equipment.</p></div>
  <h2><a href="/replacing-a-light-switch-with-a-combination/">Replacing a light switch with a combination light switch and outlet</a></h2>
  <time datetime="2009-09-15" pubdate>Sep 15, 2009</time>
  <div class="summary"><p>Our half-bathroom has no power outlets beyond the one in the base of the light fixture above the medicine cabinet. I&#8217;m fairly sure that code prohibits such outlets so close to a water source, and since we&#8217;ll be replacing that light fixture in any case, it&#8217;s unlikely the replacement will provide a similar feature. I hoped to expand the current light switch enclosure to hold both an outlet and switch, but&#8211;given (1) my lack of any wiring skills and (2) the walls of solid concrete&#8211;I worried that such a task would be beyond me.</p></div>
  <h2><a href="/concrete-patching-in-half-bath/">Concrete-patching in half-bath</a></h2>
  <time datetime="2009-09-14" pubdate>Sep 14, 2009</time>
  <div class="summary"><p>I&#8217;m kicking myself for not properly documenting the half-bath&#8217;s &#8220;before&#8221; state. In any case it would have been difficult, as you can tell from these shots. Since the room&#8217;s only 2.5 feet by 5.5 feet and accessed via an especially narrow door, it would take a fish-eye lens to capture any detail.</p></div>
  <h2><a href="/the-canvas/">The canvas</a></h2>
  <time datetime="2009-09-13" pubdate>Sep 13, 2009</time>
  <div class="summary"><p>Might as well start at the beginning. When we moved in last year the floor and paint was in good shape. The kitchen and 1.5 baths, however, were showing their age.</p>

<p>The kitchen was updated recently enough that the cabinets were made out of particleboard rather than solid wood, but long enough ago that the particleboard was disintegrating. Wall cabinets leaned forward off the wall (at their tops, a full inch separated the backing board from the cabinet frames), and drawers swung loose. The bathrooms were very usable but covered in the original pink tiles that were popular when the building was built in the 50s.</p></div>
  <h2><a href="/keeping-a-record/">Keeping a record</a></h2>
  <time datetime="2009-09-13" pubdate>Sep 13, 2009</time>
  <div class="summary"><p>Finally, I&#8217;m going to try to keep a record. I don&#8217;t take or share enough photos, so that might happen here. Also, I am constantly mystified by the home improvement obstacles I encounter. I have more questions, confusions, and gaps than I would offload on to any one person, so they&#8217;ll probably get dumped here.</p></div>
