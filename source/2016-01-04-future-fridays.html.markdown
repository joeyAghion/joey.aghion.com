The [Artsy](https://artsy.net) Platform Engineering team has established a "Future Fridays" tradition.

> The rules are simple. Each Friday, we give ourselves permission to suspend our usual work. Instead, we zoom out and try to answer:
> 
> * What are the patterns emerging in our work--repeated smells or obstacles--that could be addressed at the root?
> * What new technologies might we want to have in place 6, 12, or 18 months from now?
> * What will we need to get to 10x the scale of data, traffic, or revenue?
