This Old House's spotlight falls yet again on my old neighborhood. I'm excited to see how it will turn out, but I miss the over-the-top, pre-recession-style projects like the [Cambridge House](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/tv/house-project/overview/0,,1062246,00.html) and [Carlisle Project](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/tv/house-project/overview/0,,607636,00.html).
