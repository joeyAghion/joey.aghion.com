I've been posting at the [Artsy engineering blog](http://artsy.github.com), most recently about how we [trick ourselves into sharing end users' experiences](http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/07/05/spend-time-with-your-site):

> ...we stole a page from the agile development handbook and built an [information radiator](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator). Like a [kanban board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board), news ticker, or [analytics wall board](https://demo.geckoboard.com/dashboard/B6782E562794C2F2), our information radiator gives us an ambient awareness of end users' experiences. How?
> 
> **It's our site, as a slideshow.**
> 
> That's all. Our wall-mounted display shows the same web page that a visitor to our site recently requested. Every 20 seconds, it refreshes and shows a new, more recently requested page.
> 
> Without much effort, this gives us a sense of where users spend time on the site (*nudes seem popular today*). The impact of events such as email blasts or celebrity mentions is immediately apparent (*did [@aplusk](https://twitter.com/aplusk) just tweet us?*). And when problems happen, we notice them as soon as errors pop up on the screen (*[AWS down again?](http://gigaom.com/cloud/some-of-amazon-web-services-are-down-again)*).
