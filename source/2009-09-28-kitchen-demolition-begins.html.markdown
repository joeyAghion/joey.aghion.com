With approval from the co-op board in hand, we gave the go-ahead \[and a deposit\] to the contractor. We were thrilled to come home to a partially demolished kitchen. The speed with which work is getting done, and the pleasure of not having to do it myself, really calls into question my motivation for the other DIY projects around the house.
