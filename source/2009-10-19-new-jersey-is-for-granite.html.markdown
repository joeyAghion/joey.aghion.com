Woke up early and borrowed a zipcar to check out the granite selection at 3 stone warehouses over the bridge to NJ:

* [Integrity Marble and Granite](http://www.integritymarblegranite.com)
* [All Granite and Marble Corp](http://www.marble.com)
* [Arena Stone Products](http://www.arenastonenj.com)

I focused on granite, since we were so consistently discouraged from using white marble in a practical kitchen. Brought home some samples (photo). From left to right:

* honed absolute black
* polished kashmir white
* antiqued river white
* antiqued white princess
* \[another\] honed absolute black
* a quartzy-white with a name I forget
* polished sira gray
