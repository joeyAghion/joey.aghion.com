Ever since I had the chance to help out in a commercial kitchen, I've wanted my own commercial-style faucet. Once you've done dishes with the suspended sprayer, super-hot water, and excellent water pressure, nothing compares. Too late in the kitchen design process, I realized that those faucets require more vertical space than the typical 18" between counter and cabinet. Instead, they needed upwards of 25-30".

In the interest of coming as close as possible to the efficient cleaning and functional appearance of a commercial-style faucet while remaining within our space and budget constraints, I chose the [Glacier Bay 410 Pull-down faucet from Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/Kitchen-Faucets-Pull-Down/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ1xr5Zbdfw/R-100676578/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053).

See [Remodelista's "10 Easy Pieces"](http://www.remodelista.com/posts/10-easy-pieces-commercial-style-kitchen-faucets) for a great collection of commercial-style faucets.

Besides Home Depot, there are lots of similar choices [at eFaucets](http://faucets.efaucets.com/nav/ct2/proprerinseunits/ct1/kitchenfaucets/0) or [Home Click](http://www.homeclick.com/web/catalog/ethumbs.aspx?N=109+9269982).
