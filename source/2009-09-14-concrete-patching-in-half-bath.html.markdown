I'm kicking myself for not properly documenting the half-bath's "before" state. In any case it would have been difficult, as you can tell from these shots. Since the room's only 2.5 feet by 5.5 feet and accessed via an especially narrow door, it would take a fish-eye lens to capture any detail.

I managed to scrape up the floor tile and tear off the sink and other fixtures over a few successive Sundays. This took far longer than it needed to. The trick for the tile ended up being getting a little leverage under the backer board beneath the tiles and pulling up entire sections. (The tile-by-tile work would have gone on forever.) Fixtures like the towel rod and toilet paper holder were embedded deep in the wall's concrete, so the end result required some patching.
