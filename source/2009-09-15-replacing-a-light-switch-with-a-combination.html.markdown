Our half-bathroom has no power outlets beyond the one in the base of the light fixture above the medicine cabinet. I'm fairly sure that code prohibits such outlets so close to a water source, and since we'll be replacing that light fixture in any case, it's unlikely the replacement will provide a similar feature. I hoped to expand the current light switch enclosure to hold both an outlet and switch, but--given (1) my lack of any wiring skills and (2) the walls of solid concrete--I worried that such a task would be beyond me.

Home Depot supplied the hardware that would encourage me to try anyway: a combination light switch and GFCI outlet, made to fit in the space normally taken up by just one switch or outlet. The wiring proved a significant test for my amateur skills, so after trying a few permutations (that resulted in different--but all wrong--combinations of the outlet and switch working), I finally found [this diagram](http://www.indepthinfo.com/wire-switch/light-switch-outlet.shtml) that clarified things:

A cool little outlet-tester confirmed that everything was working.
