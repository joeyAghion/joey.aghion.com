If you work in any field related to technology, do yourself a favor and sell that [Apple (AAPL)](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl&ql=1) stock I know you've been hanging on to. I'm as much of a fan as the next guy, but this is about diversification. And let's face it, you've been lucky so far:

Use the proceeds to pick up a nice [REIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust) (because what could possibly go wrong with real estate?), or just some high-dividend stocks. If you can, set your account to automatically reinvest proceeds. Then get back to work, taking comfort in the fact that you're building some passive income to complement what you earn.
