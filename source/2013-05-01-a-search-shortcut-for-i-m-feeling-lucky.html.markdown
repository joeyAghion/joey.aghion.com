I don't make an effort to remember URLs, so often I type the name of a site into the Chrome location bar, hit enter, and then immediately click on the first search result to navigate to the site. There's at least one unnecessary click in there, so...

I created a custom search engine in Chrome for Google's _I'm Feeling Lucky_ function.

1. Go to **Settings**, then **Manage search engines...**
2. At the bottom of the **Other search engines** list, add a new entry called _I'm Feeling Lucky_
3. For **Keyword**, choose a convenient shortcut. I chose the single character _>_
4. For **URL**, enter: `http://www.google.com.ph/search?q=%s&btnI=745`

Now, you just need to type `>` (or your preferred keyword) and hit `Tab` to type a query. When you hit `Enter`, you'll navigate directly to the first result.
