    <p>After a few days to cure, I tried to dry-fit the bathroom tiles. I chose a 1&#8221; white marble tile because I like the stone look and hoped the small tiles would enable me to avoid relying on a wet-saw to shape them. A few tight sections (such as at the door frame) couldn&#8217;t accept whole tiles without throwing the broader layout way off, but I found that some coarse sandpaper and some patience were enough to grind down the offending bits of tile. I took the inverse approach in a few spots when tiles hit the wall at an unforgiving angle (as long as trim would end up covering them): I gouged out sections of the wall to make room for the whole tiles rather than be forced to cut them. This is definitely not the tile-artisan&#8217;s method.</p>

<p>Once I was happy with the dry layout, I moved small sections out of the room in order to attack those areas with mortar. Things went OK for the first few 1&#8217;-square sections, but in the middle of the room the returning sections met up in a strange jagged line that sent me scrambling for some additional tiles. I called it a night eventually, and was pretty happy with the look.</p>

<p>The following week I returned with a 7 lb. package of Polyblend&#8217;s &#8220;Snow White&#8221; sanded grout. Their instructions called for 1 pint of water to be added, but that left me with a damp, chunky, sand, so I added another 2/3 pint to get the &#8220;stiff frosting&#8221; consistency. Their instructions also claimed 1 package would be sufficient to cover more than the area I had, but (as you can tell in one photo) I ran out with a wide corner of the bathroom still un-grouted. I rectified that the following night and&#8211;now that the grout&#8217;s drying a bit&#8211;I can already see that the color will be great.</p>

<p>Next up for the half-bath: sealing the stone and grout.</p>
